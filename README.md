Plot - 
	Agathar is a graced with the power of fighting, or so he has been told.
	Agathar was born in Lienid. He doesn’t know who his parents are.
	When A was 4, he was taken from his home by King Leck when Leck travelled to Lienid in search of Katsa. When Leck was killed, the baby was orphaned, and he was transported to Sunder.
	When he arrived in Sunder, A was brought to Murgon City to be brought up by King Murgon in the royal court. He never fit in, but he made do.
	When A’s grace made itself clear, Murgon was very pleased. He reminded her of Katsa. Murgon put A to use smuggling goods across the continent. 
	A began traveling with a group of Murgon’s smugglers when he was 13. He did this, only stopping by the court for short weeks in between journeys, for 3 years.
	On his last trip, A was ordered to smuggle stolen weapons from Monsea to Wester, so that Murgon could form an alliance with King Birn in the inevitable war that the continent was building up to. 
	On the day of the exchange, Birn City was attacked by King Nander’s groups, and in the havoc, A was shot in the back by a bowman. He survived, lying on the ground, until he was found hours later by a Wester nobleman. They took him to the dungeons.
